# 8086MP_DAC üéõÔ∏è

A project that generates a **Sawtooth waveform** using the **Intel 8086 microprocessor**, an **8255 PPI interface**, and a **DAC0808**. The waveform is visualized on an oscilloscope within the **Proteus 8 (2020)** simulation environment.

---

## üß† Project Idea

The goal is to generate a **Sawtooth waveform** by incrementally outputting digital values from 0 to 255 through the 8255 PPI to a DAC0808. The DAC converts these digital values into an analog voltage, which is then displayed on the oscilloscope.
